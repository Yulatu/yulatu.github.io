# My website homepage

As written in the index.html, this is my personal website homepage and I'd like to gradually improve this repository by adding my future:

- Publications
- Codes
- Photos

The aesthetic design is motivated by a tutorial of  [Daniel Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5QFHp1oAws) who speaks a charming pure English.

The background picture of the homepage is taken by myself in my hometown.
